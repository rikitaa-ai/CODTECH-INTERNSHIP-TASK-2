Objectives:
The objective of predictive modeling with linear regression is to establish the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to make accurate predictions. It aims to quantify how changes in the independent variables impact the dependent variable, enabling informed decision-making based on data-driven insights.

Key Values:
Dependent Variable (Target): The outcome variable that you are trying to predict (e.g., sales, prices).
Independent Variables (Features): The input variables used to predict the dependent variable (e.g., advertising spend, customer demographics).
Coefficients: The values that represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
Intercept: The expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
R-squared Value: A statistical measure indicating how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable (ranges from 0 to 1).
P-values: Used to determine the significance of each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages:Python,Pandas,NumPy
Data Visualization:Matplotlib and Seaborn 
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):Jupyter Notebook
Data Storage and Management:SQL DatabasesS
